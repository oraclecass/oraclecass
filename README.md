Hi, Iâ€™m Cass (they/she)

I'm working on a silly little pet project called Your Garden, a little discord bot to encourage mindfulness and make lil plants.

Learning lots about Python daily. 

I like math, and I especially like code solutions that use fancy math. Ask me about gardenbot's plot storage value.

My code probably isn't up to standards, since I'm entirely self-taught. 
If you have polite suggestions and/or constructive criticism, or want to collaborate, hit me up on Discord as `*Cass#1312`.
